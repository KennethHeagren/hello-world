# hello-world
A repository of stuff that I have no idea of the nature at this point.
I am an ESOL English teacher that has become interested in coding after some horrible experiences with Go Daddy and Google websites. Frankly I thought I could do better myself. Little did I relise the extent of such an undertaking, but interesting all the same.
